# Next.JS
First of all we start from UX to UI then Database then Backend then Next.js i mean front end.  this is the main flow we use. but one thing remember here we used supabase for backend + Database becuase postgreSql in supabase by default.  
🧠 1. UX Designer (User Experience Designer)

🎯 70% User needs: “Is it easy to use? Does it solve user pain?”

💼 30% Business goals: “Does this experience lead users to buy, sign up, or trust the company?”

Key responsibilities:

Research user pain points, goals, and emotions.

Map user journey (how they move through the app).

Create wireframes (rough structure, no colors yet).

Test experience with real users.

🎨 2. UI Designer (User Interface Designer)

UI Designer focuses:

💼 60% Visual Identity (brand look, colors, typography)

👤 40% User Usability (clarity, readability, accessibility)

So still partly user-focused.
Because a UI can be beautiful — but useless if not readable or accessible.

Key responsibilities:

Apply color palette, font, logo, and spacing.

Design responsive layout (desktop, mobile).

Create prototypes in Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.

💻 3. UI Developer (or Frontend Implementer)

Now, this term is rare but valid — used in large teams.

Their job is:

Take the UI Design from Figma.

Implement it pixel-perfect using React/Next.js/Tailwind CSS.

Make sure it’s responsive and matches design exactly.

⚙️ 4. Frontend Developer (Full Functional Side)

This is where Next.js shines.

Responsibilities:

Connect UI with backend APIs (REST or GraphQL).

Add interactivity (state, routing, modals, forms).

Manage SEO, performance, accessibility, lazy loading, caching, etc.

Handle authentication, authorization, data fetching.

🧩 Output: Fully working web app frontend.
